# Docker images are created layer by layer, so when we are just coping package.json files it would not get build everytime
# we do any update on the files apart from package.json. It only gets rebuild when we add a new package or we change something on the package.json file.
# We generally create the package required layer first and then load the code file, so that the build get triggered only when we do any update on requirements.
# If we copy the whole codebase then the image will have to rebuild always since the layer on which we are loading the files updates on every code update.
